# Bike-Sharing-Project

## Problem Statement:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes hired us to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

## General Information
We want to know/do:

- Which features are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those features describe the bike demands
- Making predictions off of these features

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
<b>Highlights of the final_model
- Number of Features = 18
- r2_score = 0.8 (on the whole data)
- Top 2 variables with highest +ve impact are atemp & yr
- Top 2 variables with highest -ve impact are hum & windspeed </b>
